          <h2>Project</h2>
          <div><strong>WikiArt.org</strong> is an online visual art encyclopedia users can edit. It can boast of more
            than 120 thousand artworks, up to 2.5 million visits, and about 10 million page views a month.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>The encyclopedia operates in seven languages and follows the wiki principle. This means that users can
            instantly add and edit posts while moderators keep an eye on the changes.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>The American Library Association named the project one of the 15 best free reference websites.</div>

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <div>The high-load web portal required new functions and increasing solution performance long before our team started working on
            WikiArt. The existing engine just didn't allow expanding.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>The WikiArt team, who were experts in Arts Domain, also had numerous ideas and improvements waiting to be implemented. And on top of that,
            the portal was in desperate need of design renovation.

      demonstrated top-notch problem-solving skills. In particular, they showed flexibility in solving challenging UX/UI
      issues. They successfully managed performance at the peak loads after publications on Reddit, as well as constant
      intensive load caused by search bots. Finally, during the migration to the updated version, the team synced
      operations of the old and the new solutions.\"

      I definitely recommend them."

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <div class="text-center sub-heading">Our cooperation lasted for several years and consisted of two active
        development phases with a stabilization and maintenance period in between.
      </div>
      <div class="col-2">
        <div class="column-content">
          <h3 class="subtitle"><strong>Phase 1</strong></h3>
          <div>In the first phase, we showed our extensive experience in application re-engineering by enhancing and
            re-designing the web portal's engine.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>During this stage, we:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented new features that prolong the customer journey, including user interaction functionality and
              advanced search.
            </li>
            <li>Completely re-designed the UX/UI with attention to the user experience on both mobile devices
              (smartphones, tablets) and large screens.
            </li>
            <li>Improved performance through changing the architecture and migrating to the NoSQL database.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="column-content">
          <h3 class="subtitle"><strong>Phase 2</strong></h3>
          <div>The second stage started after a new owner purchased the project and brought many new ideas as well as
            SEO requirements.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>During this stage, we:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented new functions, including the video section.</li>
            <li>Expanded the functionality of tags, and tagged 120,000+ artworks using Google AI.</li>
            <li>Extended the localization to seven languages by adding Chinese.</li>
            <li>Put extra effort into SEO optimization, which resulted in doubling monthly visits.</li>
