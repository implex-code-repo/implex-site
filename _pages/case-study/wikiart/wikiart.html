          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <div>The web portal required new functions and increasing performance long before our team started working on WikiArt. The existing engine just didn't allow expanding.</div>
          <br />
          <div>The WikiArt team also had numerous ideas and improvements waiting to be implemented. And on top of that, the portal was in desperate need of design renovation.</div>

        content="\"A complex project like that is always riddled with technical problems. The team that was working on it demonstrated top-notch problem-solving skills. In particular, they showed flexibility in solving challenging UX/UI issues. They successfully managed performance at the peak loads after publications on Reddit, as well as constant intensive load caused by search bots. Finally, during the migration to the updated version, the team synced operations of the old and the new solutions.\"

        I definitely recommend them."

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <div class="text-center sub-heading">Our cooperation lasted for several years and consisted of two active development phases with a stabilization and maintenance period in between.</div>
      <div class="col-2">
        <div>
          <div><strong>Phase 1</strong></div>
          <br />
          <div>In the first phase, we showed our extensive experience in application re-engineering by enhancing and re-designing the web portal's engine.</div>
          <br />
          <div>During this stage, we:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented new features that prolong the customer journey, including user interaction functionality and advanced search.</li>
            <li>Completely re-designed the UX/UI with attention to the user experience on both mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) and large screens.</li>
            <li>Improved performance through changing the architecture and migrating to the NoSQL database.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div><strong>Phase 2</strong></div>
          <br />
          <div>The second stage started after a new owner purchased the project and brought many new ideas as well as SEO requirements.</div>
          <br />
          <div>During this stage, we:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented new functions, including the video section.</li>
            <li>Expanded the functionality of tags, and tagged 120,000+ artworks using Google AI.</li>
            <li>Extended the localization to seven languages by adding Chinese.</li>
            <li>Put extra effort into SEO optimization, which resulted in doubling monthly visits.</li>
