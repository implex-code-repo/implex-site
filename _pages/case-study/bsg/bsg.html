          <h2>Client</h2>
          <div>Berezha Security Group is a cybersecurity services company focused on application security, penetration testing, and data security consulting.</div>
          <br/>
          <div>Since 2014, the company has delivered 200+ projects for over 100 clients worldwide. Its customers come from a range of business sectors, including software engineering, fintech, retail, healthcare, media, gaming, legal and advisory, and others.</div>

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <div>In 2020, Berezha Security Group rebranded as BSG. The next logical step was redesigning the brand book and the corporate website. But redesign was only part of the story. The ultimate goal was to make the website fast and SEO-friendly, keeping its Google PageSpeed Insights scores in the green 90-100 range. The upgrade was expected to be gradual, with the original URL kept intact to maintain ranking on Google.</div>
          <br />
          <div>Certain functions were to stay, too. For example, the website administrator reserved the right to change content without the programmer's or layout designer's help â€“ just like with the previous, WordPress-powered website.</div>
          <br />
          <div>Developing a tool for pre-qualifying leads came as an extra task.</div>

He excels at managing client expectations, all the while sourcing talent, delegating tasks, and delivering on schedule. I continue to look for opportunities to work with him and would highly recommend Slava him and his team to any company seeking to outsource some of their development needs.\""

      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <div class="text-center sub-heading">Our cooperation lasted for several years and consisted of two active development phases with a stabilization and maintenance period in between.</div>
      <div class="col-2">
        <div>
          <div><strong>Phase 1</strong></div>
          <br />
          <div>The scope of work included full architecture engineering. Our team started by implementing the core architecture that was later successfully used during the entire development process without significant changes. Other tasks covered design and back-end, front-end, and mobile development for a series of modules.</div>
          <br />
          <div>In the first stage, we coded a <strong>demo platform</strong> with the back-end and the admin panel offered to the first customers and angel investors. The mobile app for auto dealers was coded and released to AppStore, too. At the same time, our front-end engineers developed the Web UI for entering car inspection data. We also developed an <strong>emulation module</strong> with a sophisticated logic and human-like behavior to enable proxy bidding. The platform relies on <strong>fault-tolerant stateless back-end architecture</strong> that allows scaling the bidding logic and implements immediate bidding using web sockets.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div><strong>Phase 2</strong></div>
          <br />
          <div>At the second stage, our engineers developed a mobile app for SmartLane inspectors coming to review cars and provide their feedback on 50+ parameters. Dealers now had access to a full-service Web UI.</div>
          <br />
          <div>The platform supports a <strong>full range of features</strong>:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>integration with on-board diagnostic (OBD)</li>
            <li>special workflow for sellers to input the info about their cars to SmartLane and for the admin to review and proceed with it</li>
            <li>counter offers functionality for the vehicles no one bought at an auction</li>
            <li>saved searches and user notifications</li>
            <li>making-a-deal flow after an auction end</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <div>The platform integrates with a number of APIs, including VIN API and Carfax, vehicle history report database, as well as with the bar code reader.</div>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <div>It was critical for our client to demonstrate a fully functional MVP on time to get the next round of financing. We did our best to make that happen. We also delivered a full set of technical documentation required for Series A investing.</div>
          <br />
          <div>In the end, the new functions and workflows in the mobile and web apps greatly extended the capabilities of dealers. The automation of the inspection process made it possible to thoroughly inspect a car in 45 minutes, compared to 1-2 hours it took to do this manually. Even more, a brief examination took only 15 minutes.</div>
