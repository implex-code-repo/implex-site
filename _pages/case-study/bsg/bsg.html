          <h2>Client</h2>
          <div>Berezha Security Group is a cybersecurity services company focused on application security, penetration testing, and data security consulting.</div>

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <div>In 2020, Berezha Security Group rebranded as BSG. The next logical step was redesigning the brand book and the corporate website. But redesign was only part of the story. The ultimate goal was to make the website fast and SEO-friendly, keeping its Google PageSpeed Insights scores in the green 90-100 range. The upgrade was expected to be gradual, with the original URL kept intact to maintain ranking on Google.</div>
          <br />
          <div>Certain functions were to stay, too. For example, the website administrator reserved the right to change content without the programmer's or layout designer's help – just like with the previous, WordPress-powered website.</div>
          <br />
          <div>Developing a tool for pre-qualifying leads came as an extra task.</div>

I think the engagement of the management, who are the co-founders at the same time and who are focused on problem-solving, is definitely a positive differentiator of Implex.\""

          <div class="subtitle"><strong>Design</strong></div>
          <div>Our UI/UX specialist collaborated with BSG's marketing director to create a new design fully matching the updated brand book and the client's expectations. An Implex engineer developed a sophisticated dynamic wizard form to pre-qualify leads and integrated it into a static website.</div>
          <div>The company's blog was kept as a separate WordPress website. It was only redesigned to fit the new brand book.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="column-content">
          <div class="subtitle"><strong>Optimization</strong></div>
          <div>The updated website works much faster, as static pages are now generated at frontend build-time using React components.</div>
          <br />
          <div>Building a new CMS from scratch equaled budget overrun. To avoid that, we reused the repository web editor. The website admin can edit existing pages or create new ones using readily available blocks.</div>
