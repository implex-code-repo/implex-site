You will be working at the https://www.admit.me product. The project is aimed to help an applicant applying to college: we propose the only automated profile review for full-time MBA candidates. By analyzing the many factors used in admissions decisions across six primary areas, it conducts a detailed review of a candidate’s profile. At its core, the score is a numerical representation of the strength of your candidacy, scored out of 1000.

The platform is released not only on it's own site, but for other institutions (Emory, Georgetown, Economist, Foster). The nearest steps are to develop the analogous versions for Part-time MBA and Executive MBA and roll-out them on different school sites.
