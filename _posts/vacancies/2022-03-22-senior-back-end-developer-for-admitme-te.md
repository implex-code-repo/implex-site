You will be working at the https://www.admit.me product. The project is aimed to help an applicant applying to college: we propose the only automated profile review for full-time MBA candidates. By analyzing the many factors used in admissions decisions across six primary areas, it conducts a detailed review of a candidateâ€™s profile. At its core, the score is a numerical representation of the strength of your candidacy, scored out of 1000.
